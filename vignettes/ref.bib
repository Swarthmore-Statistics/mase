abstract="Accurate measurements of PM2.5 concentration over time and space are especially critical for reducing adverse health outcomes. However, sparsely stationary monitoring sites considerably hinder the ability to effectively characterize observed concentrations. Utilizing data on meteorological and land-related factors, this study introduces a radial basis function (RBF) neural network method for estimating PM2.5 concentrations based on sparse observed inputs. The state of Texas in the USA was selected as the study area. Performance of the RBF models was evaluated by statistic indices including mean square error, mean absolute error, mean relative deviation, and the correlation coefficient. Results show that the annual PM2.5 concentrations estimated by the RBF models with meteorological factors and/or land-related factors were markedly closer to the observed concentrations. RBF models with combined meteorological and land-related factors achieved best performance relative to ones with either type of these factors only. It can be concluded that meteorological factors and land-related factors are useful for articulating the variation of PM2.5 concentration in a given study area. With these covariate factors, the RBF neural network can effectively estimate PM2.5 concentrations with acceptable accuracy under the condition of sparse monitoring stations. The improved accuracy of air concentration estimation would greatly benefit epidemiological and environmental studies in characterizing local air pollution and in helping reduce population exposures for areas with limited availability of air quality data.",

abstract="A key problem in environmental monitoring is the spatial interpolation. The main current approach in spatial interpolation is geostatistical. Geostatistics is neither the only nor the best spatial interpolation method. Actually there is no ``best'' method, universally valid. Choosing a particular method implies to make assumptions. The understanding of initial assumption, of the methods used, and the correct interpretation of the interpolation results are key elements of the spatial interpolation process. A powerful alternative to geostatistics in spatial interpolation is the use of the soft computing methods. They offer the potential for a more flexible, less assumption dependent approach. Artificial Neural Networks are well suited for this kind of problems, due to their ability to handle non-linear, noisy, and inconsistent data. The present paper intends to prove the advantage of using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) instead of geostatistics in spatial interpolations, based on a detailed analyze and modeling of the SIC2004 (Spatial Interpolation Comparison) dataset.",
